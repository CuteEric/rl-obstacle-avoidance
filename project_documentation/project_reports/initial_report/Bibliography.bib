abstract={Recently, many efforts have been made to develop more efficient Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocols for on-demand route planning according to observed traffic congestion or incidents, as well as for safety applications. Because practical experiments are often not feasible, simulation of network protocol behavior in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) scenarios is strongly demanded for evaluating the applicability of developed network protocols. In this work, we discuss the need for bidirectional coupling of network simulation and road traffic microsimulation for evaluating IVC protocols. As the selection of a mobility model influences the outcome of simulations to a great extent, the use of a representative model is necessary for producing meaningful evaluation results. Based on these observations, we developed the hybrid simulation framework Veins (Vehicles in Network Simulation), composed of the network simulator OMNeT++ and the road traffic simulator SUMO. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate its advantages and the need for bidirectionally coupled simulation based on the evaluation of two protocols for incident warning over VANETs. With our developed methodology, we can advance the state-of-the-art in performance evaluation of IVC and provide means to evaluate developed protocols more accurately.},

abstract={In this article, we develop a decentralized resource allocation mechanism for vehicle-to- vehicle (V2V) communications based on deep reinforcement learning. Each V2V link is supported by an autonomous "agent", which makes its decisions to find the optimal sub-band and power level for transmission without requiring or having to wait for global information. Hence, the proposed method is decentralized, with minimum transmission overhead. From the simulation results, each agent can effectively learn how to satisfy the stringent latency constraints on V2V links while minimizing the interference to vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications.},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={In this paper, a novel proximity and load-aware resource allocation for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is proposed. The proposed approach exploits the spatio-temporal traffic patterns, in terms of load and vehicles' physical proximity, to minimize the total network cost which captures the tradeoffs between load (i.e., service delay) and successful transmissions while satisfying vehicles' quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To solve the optimization problem under slowly varying channel information, it is decoupled the problem into two interrelated sub-problems. First, a dynamic clustering mechanism is proposed to group vehicles in zones based on their traffic patterns and proximity information. Second, a matching game is proposed to allocate resources for each V2V pair within each zone. The problem is cast as many-to-one matching game in which V2V pairs and resource blocks (RBs) rank one another in order to minimize their service delay. The proposed game is shown to belong to the class of matching games with externalities. To solve this game, a distributed algorithm is proposed using which V2V pairs and RBs interact to reach a stable matching. Simulation results for a Manhattan model shown that the proposed scheme yields a higher percentage of V2V pairs satisfying QoS as well as significant gain in terms of the signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as compared to a state-of-art resource allocation baseline.},

abstract={Future communication subsystems of space exploration missions can potentially benefit from software-defined radios (SDRs) controlled by machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid radio resource allocation management control algorithm that integrates multi-objective reinforcement learning and deep artificial neural networks. The objective is to efficiently manage communications system resources by monitoring performance functions with common dependent variables that result in conflicting goals. The uncertainty in the performance of thousands of different possible combinations of radio parameters makes the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning (RL) much more challenging for future critical space-based missions. Thus, the system should spend as little time as possible on exploring actions, and whenever it explores an action, it should perform at acceptable levels most of the time. The proposed approach enables on-line learning by interactions with the environment and restricts poor resource allocation performance through `virtual environment exploration'. Improvements in the multi-objective performance can be achieved via transmitter parameter adaptation on a packet-basis, with poorly predicted performance promptly resulting in rejected decisions. Simulations presented in this work considered the DVB-S2 standard adaptive transmitter parameters and additional ones expected to be present in future adaptive radio systems. Performance results are provided by analysis of the proposed hybrid algorithm when operating across a satellite communication channel from Earth to GEO orbit during clear sky conditions. The proposed approach constitutes part of the core cognitive engine proof-of-concept to be delivered to the NASA Glenn Research Center SCaN Testbed located on-board the International Space Station.},

abstract={Cloud Radio Access Networks (RANs) have become a key enabling technique for the next generation (5G) wireless communications, which can meet requirements of massively growing wireless data traffic. However, resource allocation in cloud RANs still needs to be further improved in order to reach the objective of minimizing power consumption and meeting demands of wireless users over a long operational period. Inspired by the success of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on solving complicated control problems, we present a novel DRL-based framework for power-efficient resource allocation in cloud RANs. Specifically, we define the state space, action space and reward function for the DRL agent, apply a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to approximate the action-value function, and formally formulate the resource allocation problem (in each decision epoch) as a convex optimization problem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework by comparing it with two widely-used baselines via simulation. The simulation results show it can achieve significant power savings while meeting user demands, and it can well handle highly dynamic cases.},
